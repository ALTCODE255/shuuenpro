                    <h3>Incompletion</h3>
                    <p>On October 10th, 2015, <a href="https://twitter.com/suzumun/status/652541455265722368">Suzumu confessed to claiming ghostwritten songs as his own</a> and earning dishonest profit from them, and announced that he would be retiring from all Vocaloid-related activities. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/3o4zr4/suzumu_has_retired/cvukmxl">Translation here.</a>)</p>
                    <p>The full extent of Suzumu's plagiarism is unknown. Additionally, because Suzumu had written/arranged songs outside of Shuuen no Shiori, we do not know if it extended to his involvement with the series.</p>
                    <p>Since the incident, both 150P and komine seem to have gone completely inactive without notice. Consequently, although the manga got its own original ending in January of 2016, <b>the project itself has never received a proper conclusion</b> (and more than likely never will).</p>

                    <p>You are welcome to get into the series in spite of this, but <span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">be warned; there are countless mysteries unsolved and many loose ends untied.</span></p>
