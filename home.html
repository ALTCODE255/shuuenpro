  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><b>Shuuen no Shiori Project (終焉ノ栞プロジェクト</b> <em>Bookmark of Demise
      Project</em>), <em>a.k.a. Shuuenpro</em>, is a vocaloid project created
    in mid-May of 2012 by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>150P</b> (music)</li>
    <li><b>Suzumu (スズム)</b> (story & lyrics)</li>
    <li><b>komine (こみね)</b> (illustration)</li>
    <li><b>Saine (さいね)</b> (illustration & character design)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The story falls into the genres of <b>mystery, horror, meta,</b> and <b>supernatural</b>
    and contains major elements of character death and gore. Other content
    warnings can be found <a href="https://www.doesthedogdie.com/media/676459">here</a> (please vote
    if you know the series already).</p>
  <p>The series received <b>5 albums</b> (by the above team + a few others),
    <b>4 light novels</b> (written by Suzumu), a <b>33-chapter manga (7
      volumes)</b> (by Amino Yuki), and a <b>CD drama</b>. 7 songs received
    official PVs. Its manga synopsis is as follows:
  </p>
  <center>
    <p><b>TW for dismemberment, murder, and gore:</b></p>
    <p class="highlight">On the normal, unchanging campus, it suddenly
      occurred; A murder case where a body was cut open, right into two. On
      the other side of the unsolved case, the rumor-loving high school
      students became involved in a certain ritual. From the extremely popular
      songs on Nico Nico Douga, begins the Project. What is the "Bookmark of
      Demise"? Who is the traitor? What will the conclusion to this story be?<br><br>So, can you solve this mystery?</p>
  </center>
  <p>The project came to a halt following late 2015 when Suzumu confessed to
    plagiarizing ghostwritten works (supposedly lyrics) and earning dishonest
    profit from them. He then announced that he was retiring from all
    vocaloid-related activities. (Link to read his <a
      href="https://twitter.com/suzumun/status/652541455265722368">announcement</a>
    about it or a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/3o4zr4/suzumu_has_retired/cvukmxl">translation</a>
    of it). It is unknown if this had anything to do with Shuuen no Shiori, as Suzumu wrote lyrics for Vocaloid songs
    more than just the ones that comprise Shuuen.</p>
  <p>As a result of the incident, 150P and komine seem to have retired as
    well, though without notice. Consequently, although the manga got its own
    ending in January of 2016, <b>the project itself has not received a proper
      conclusion</b> (and more than likely never will). You are still welcome
    to get into the series in spite of this, but be warned; there are
    countless mysteries unsolved and many loose ends untied.</p>
